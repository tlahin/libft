# Libft | libc rewritten
Updated version of Hive Helsinkis project libft

A bunch of functions from C libraries written from scratch

- get_next_line.c (see [get_next_line](https://github.com/tlahin/get_next_line))
  
- printf (see [ft_printf](https://github.com/tlahin/ft_printf))
  
  Subject: [libft.en.pdf](https://github.com/tlahin/libft/files/9993610/libft.en.pdf)

# Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

# Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, go to the library path and run:

```shell
make && make clean
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "libft.h"
```
